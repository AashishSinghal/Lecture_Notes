## Basic things for Motivation/ First Essential talk

**Importance of Small Difference**
- Example 1 :
    - Ask about Breaking Bad
    - discuss the importance of extra 3% clear crystals that walter white made
- Example 2 :
    - show Pictures of fastest man in India , Asia , World
    - discuss the impact of small millisec difference in timings
- Depict it with the equation - ``` (1.01)^365 = 37.78 ```


**Qualities Essential to be the Best**
- Ask about some essential qualities needed
- Discuss the importance of few - 
    - Consistency
    - Persistance
    - Hardwork in right direction
    - The will power


**Performace Equation**
- Discuss about the Performace Equation - ``` Performance = Potential - interference ```
- why the potential should be increased and interference should be decreased
- How can the performance be enhanced
    - Attend All Classes
    - Be Mindful
    - **Learning is important**


## Many technologies, Where to start from?

- discuss about multiple technologies available , maybe ask students about some names
    - frontend - js,react , angular , vue etc
    - backend - java , python , ruby etc
    - Machine Learning
    
- introduce Data structures and Algorithms
    - define and differentiate
        - Data Structure - Something we need to organise data / keep data / Store data
        = Algorithms - the process / the steps
        - give an example of toothbrush being placed in kitchen 
    - discuss about the importance of Data structures and Algorithms
    - Eventually reach to the conclusion that Data structure and Algorithms are important
    
## Building a site more important than learning about Data Structures and Algorithms ?**

- Ask the question and then discuss the result with examples
- Example 1 : **E-Commerce**
    - Dicuss the flow from searching a product to buying it
    - Discuss why we need Data structures and Algorithms in following functionalities
        - Searching a Product - need to be fast
        - Sorting - basis of price , category , reviews etc
        - Search typeahead - throw the name of **trie** just to introduce a wow-factor
        - Concurrency problem - 1 product , 2 buyers
    - Eventually convince that DSA is more important than just building a site

- Example 2 : **Food Delivery**
    - Finding nearest restaurant
    - Sorting the list of restaurant - basis of name , reviews , location
    - **Utilisation of resources** (Explain with the help of diagram)
        - Shortest path of delivery
        - Shortest time is another factor to consider
        - more factors which finally helps in better utilisation of resources
        
- Ask if it's now clear that DSA is the basic building block
        
 ## How Problem Solving works?
 
 - Dicuss about the computer and decision making
 - How the computer doesn't have mind of its own
 - How every step needed to be told to computer based on several decisions
 
 - Example 1 : **ATM Machine**
    - Discuss the process outline
    - Discuss the process in detail using decision tree (Don't introduce the name yet)
    - after drawing a basic decision tree - introduce with the name "Decision Tree"
    - Keep on focusing on the importance of decisions in problem solving
